I decided to pursue web development because I think it is a great way to allow myself to be creative and better position myself for a career path that is in high demand. Not only do I want to create websites that are aesthetically pleasing, but I want to create dynamic pages that really captures its users. 

The possiblities of the different web applications you can build seems endless. Creating something that could possibly be used by people around the world is really exciting. More and more technology is being built around the web everyday. Being apart of this technological evolution is invigorating.
